# AWS Profile Switcher (`aws-profile-switcher` / `aps`)

![AWS Profile Switcher](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS_Profile_Switcher-%F0%9F%93%A6-blue)

A sleek, interactive terminal-based tool to manage your AWS profiles effortlessly. Switch between your AWS profiles with ease, view detailed configurations, and ensure your default profile is always up-to-date‚Äîall from your terminal.

---

By defauft when executing any AWS CLI command the `[default]` profile (`~/.aws/config`) with it's corresponding access keys (`~/.aws/credentials`) are taken into account.

AWS CLI allows to use specific profile in 2 ways:
- Execute any `aws` cli command with `--profile` flag, e.g `aws s3 ls --profile my-profile`
- Use env var e.g `export AWS_PROFILE=my-profile`

In both cases you need to remember your profile name and type more text in your terminal.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Go:** Ensure you have Go installed. [Download Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- **Git:** Ensure Git is installed. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Quick Install via Shell Script

Use the provided installation script to download, build, and install `aws-profile-switcher` along with its alias `aps`.

1. **Download and Run the Install Script:**

    ```sh
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wprodev/aws-profile-switcher/main/install_aws_profile_switcher.sh | sh
    ```
    Or using `wget`:
    ```sh
    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wprodev/aws-profile-switcher/main/install_aws_profile_switcher.sh | sh
    ```
2. **Script Breakdown:**

    Checks for Dependencies: Verifies that both go and git are installed.
    Clones the Repository: Downloads the latest version from GitHub.
    Builds the Binary: Compiles the Go program.
    Installs the Binary: Places aws-profile-switcher in /usr/local/bin or falls back to $HOME/.local/bin if necessary.
    Creates Symlink: Sets up aps as an alias for quick access.
    Handles Overwrites: Prompts before overwriting existing binaries or symlinks.
    PATH Verification: Alerts if the installation directory is not in your PATH.

3. **Post-Installation:**

    Verify Installation:

    ```sh
    aws-profile-switcher --version
    # or
    aps --version
    ```
    Add to PATH (*if necessary*):

    If the script warns that the installation directory is not in your `PATH`, add it by appending the following line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

    `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"`

    Then, reload your shell:
      ```sh
      source ~/.bashrc
      # or
      source ~/.zshrc
      ```

## üéØ Usage

  Launch the AWS Profile Switcher:
    
  ```sh
  aws-profile-switcher
  # or
  aps
  ```

## üîç Troubleshooting

  * **Emoji Rendering Issues:**
    
    If warning or info icons don't render correctly, ensure your terminal supports UTF-8 and is using a font that includes emoji glyphs.

  * **Installation Permissions:**
    
    If installing to `/usr/local/bin `fails due to permission issues, ensure you have the necessary rights or use the local installation path.

  * **PATH Issues:**
    
    If you can't run `aws-profile-switcher` or `aps` after installation, verify that the installation directory is included in your `PATH`.

  * **Config File Not Detected:**
    
    Ensure your AWS config file is located at ~/.aws/config and follows the correct format with `[profile ...]` sections.
